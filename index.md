# About Me

<img src="./hector.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Hector Motsepe**.

I am a Machine Learning Engineer at **Lexis Nexis AI**.  I hold a Master Degree (Deep Learning and Machine Learning) from University of Pretoria, advised by [Prof. Aurona Gerber](https://cs.uwc.ac.za/prof-a-gerber/). I have been awarded [Huawei Top Achiever Scholarship](https://www.up.ac.za/ebit-faculty-house/news/post_2965957-huawei-invests-over-r1m-in-bursaries-for-up-ebit-students-)

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *hectormotsepe[at]gmail[dot]com*

## Research Interests

- Deep Learning (NLP/CV)
- Reinforcement Learning 
- Backpropagation (Straight Through Estimator)
- Applied Machine Learning
- Proposals Coming Soon !!! [My first research proposal], [My second research proposal]

My research focuses on developing a **modular cognitive architecture** for autonomous agents that can continuously update its world model through experience and effectively integrate feedback across different modules. Key objectives include enabling bi-directional communication between the world model and low-level controllers, facilitating coordination among modules for task execution, and incorporating multi-modal inputs to enhance the environment representation within the world model. The overarching goal is to advance autonomous agents that can acquire new knowledge through experiential learning and adapt their behavior in unfamiliar situations by leveraging an evolving, comprehensive understanding of the world around them.

My second research interest lies in exploring techniques to enable effective backpropagation through the discrete sampling process in large language models. Specifically, I aim to advance the **straight-through estimator (STE)** or develop novel methods to propagate gradients during the multi-step text generation process. Overcoming this challenge could unlock significant improvements in training large language models, leading to better performance in natural language processing tasks such as text generation, summarization, and machine translation. Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to the development of more capable and versatile language models that can positively impact a wide range of applications and benefit society.
